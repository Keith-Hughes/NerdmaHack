# NerdmaHack

Whatsapp bot powered by AI and OpenAIs function calling, that allows any user to interact with their business to execute functions that would normally require physical input on a system, via message or voice note (eg, sending emails, adding new clients, creating invoices). The messages sent to the bot are processed using AI into arguments that we can easily use throughout our Code (Natural Language Processing). 

#Key Features
*Allows a user to send a voice note or text message and the reply will be voice or message
*A user can talk in normal language and is not forced to write or say a specific phrase. (eg they can say "Please add a client to the system" or "I need to add a client")
*AI can easily be expanded to support different functions within the business. 

#Tech Used
*OpenAI API
*Whatsapp API
*Python (Flask)

#Setup
Just WhatsApp message this contact 0658426004 to interact with our bot and test some of its features. (You can start of by saying "What can you do"


*The server that runs the backend code will be available from 9am to 9pm daily until the hackathon is complete.
